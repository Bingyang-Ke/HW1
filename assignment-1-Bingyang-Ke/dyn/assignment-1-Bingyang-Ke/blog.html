    <h1>My experience of this assignment</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>After completing this assignemnt, I start to know how to use html to create a new page online, and basically know its working theory.</li>  
    <li>During the coding time, the most challenging part is to convert my image and my file to "http" format. </li>
    <li>My solution is to search some relative sources online. For example: </li>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">There is the link</a>
    </ul>
